{% block content %}<p>I'm bad at answering emails.  After all, it's so easy to procrastinate.  "I'll get to it tonight," or "what difference is a few hours going to make?" are just some of the convincing arguments I regularly make to myself.</p>

<p>I really liked this line on developer <a href="http://kennymeyers.com/" target="_blank">Kenny Meyers</a>' contact form:</p>
<p><blockquote><span>I'll get back to you within 24 hours.</span></blockquote></p>
<p>That simple sentence guarantees two things:</p>
<p><ol><li>Kenny won't procrastinate when answering emails, since a few hours <em>will</em> make a difference.</li></p>
<p>	<li>People are more comfortable emailing him, since he's made email slightly less asynchronous.</li></p>
<p></ol></p>
<p>By making a public promise with absolute numbers, you're forcing yourself to adhere to it.  Using a relative time frame such as "as soon as possible" affords endless procrastination- "24 hours" does not.  This technique isn't limited to just email, either.  You can use it for workouts ("3 miles a day" rather than "exercising daily"), blog posts ("new blog post every day" rather than "regular posts"), or making plans ("by the end of the week" rather than "soon")- basically, anything that involves some sort of self control.</p>
<p>Does it work?  I'm not sure, I'd have to ask him.  I'll know by this time tomorrow.</p>{% endblock %}
